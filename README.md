This python scripts calculate the frequency plan.
When you rent frequency bandwidth, the Satellite operator gives the Uplink, Downlink frequency, and bandwidth you need. Also, it would be best if you calculated the Center frequency. Thanks to this script, you can calculate frequency.

# Frequency Calculation

This is a simple tkinter application that calculates and displays frequency-related information based on user inputs. It provides a graphical interface where the user can enter the necessary values, such as uplink frequency, downlink frequency, total bandwidth, gateway bandwidth, and remote bandwidth. When the user clicks the "Calculate" button, the application performs the required calculations and displays the results on the screen.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- tkinter library (included with Python)

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

2. Clone this repository or download the code files.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the code files are located.

4. Run the following command to execute the program:

5. The tkinter window will appear, allowing you to enter the frequency values.

6. Fill in the required information in the Entry fields:

- Uplink Frequency: The frequency used for uplink communication.
- Downlink Frequency: The frequency used for downlink communication.
- Total Bandwidth: The total bandwidth allocated for the communication.
- Gateway Bandwidth: The bandwidth allocated for the gateway.
- Remote Bandwidth: The bandwidth allocated for the remote connection.

7. Click the "Calculate" button to perform the frequency calculations.

8. The results will be displayed on the screen, including the translation frequency, start frequency, and stop frequency. The graphical representation of the gateway and remote bandwidths will also be shown in a separate window.
